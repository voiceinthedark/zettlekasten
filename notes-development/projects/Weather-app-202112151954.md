  - [x] each day component will hold an image icon at the top, a degree variable in the center and precipitation and lowest degree variable at the bottom
  - [x] The day background color should reflect the day's weather
  - [x] create a list that holds the days component
- [x] Request data from weather api
- [x] Add date above the weather bar
- [x] use geolocation to fetch user location and then fetch weather data

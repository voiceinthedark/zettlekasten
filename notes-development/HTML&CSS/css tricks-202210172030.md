  - [counter increment](#counter-increment)
  - [is() selector](#is-selector)
  - [not() selector](#not-selector)

## Text overflow
```CSS
    div {
      white-space: nowrap;
      overflow: hidden;
      text-overflow: ellipsis;
        }
```

## pseudo-classes and pseudo-elements
```css
  :first-child
  :last-child
  :only-child
  :invalid
  :checked
  :visited
  :link
  :hover
```
### pseudo elements
```css
  ::first-line
  /*Adding content before andafter elements*/
  ::before
  ::after
  {content: lorem ipsum dolor sit am}

  /* allow us to stylize the <li> nodes in lists*/
  ::marker
```

You can combine ::marker with the content property to change what the marker is. For example, replacing list bullets with emoji (just not yet in Safari)[^1]:
```css
  ol li::marker {
  content: "ðŸ§¡ ";
}
```

You can change the background color and color of selected text by styling ::selection. Styling this pseudo element is great for matching user-selected text to your sites color scheme.
```css
    p::selection {
  background: #fff;
  color: #ff0000;
  }
```

### counter increment 

```css
body {
  counter-reset: my-awesome-counter;
}
section {
  counter-increment: my-awesome-counter;
}
section:before {
  content: counter(my-awesome-counter);
}
```
You can control the style of the counter by comma separating the counter function. e.g. to make them use Roman numerals:[^2]
```css
  section:before {
  content: counter(my-awesome-counter, upper-roman);
}
```

### is() selector
The :is() CSS pseudo-class function takes a selector list as its argument, and selects any element that can be selected by one of the selectors in that list. This is useful for writing large selectors in a more compact form.
```css
  :is(ol, ul) :is(ol, ul) ol {
    list-style-type: lower-greek;
    color: chocolate;
  }
```

### not() selector
The :not() CSS pseudo-class represents elements that do not match a list of selectors. Since it prevents specific items from being selected, it is known as the negation pseudo-class.

### Attribute selector

- **[attribute]** - This general selector will select anything where the given attribute exists. Its value doesnâ€™t matter.
- **selector[attribute]** - Optionally we can combine our attribute selectors with other types of selectors, such as class or element selectors.
- **[attribute="value"]** - To get really specific, we can use = to match a specific attribute with a specific value.

Sometimes we need to be more general in how we access these attributes. For example, perhaps weâ€™re only interested in img elements where the src attributeâ€™s value ends in .jpg. For cases like this we have some attribute selectors that allow us to match a part of the attributeâ€™s value.

- **[attribute^="value"]**- ^= Will match strings from the start.
- **[attribute\$="value"]** - $= Will match strings from the end.
- **[attribute\*="value"]** - *= The wildcard selector will match anywhere inside the string.

```css
[class^='aus'] {
  /* Classes are attributes too!
    This will target any class that begins with 'aus':
    class='austria'
    class='australia'
  */
}

[src$='.jpg'] {
  /* This will target any src attribute that ends in '.jpg':
  src='puppy.jpg'
  src='kitten.jpg'
  */
}

[for*='ill'] {
  /* This will target any for attribute that has 'ill' anywhere inside it:
  for="bill"
  for="jill"
  for="silly"
  for="ill"
  */
} 
```

- To turn a container into a flexbox
  ```CSS
  display: flex;
  ```

- The `flex` shorthand
  ```css
    flex: 1;
    /* here flex is shorthand for flex: 1 1 0;
    * where 1 is flex-grow and
    * 1 is flex-shrink
    * 0 is flex-basis
    * flex-grow controls how much a flex item grows in comparaison to other flex items.
    * flex-shrink controls the speed at which the flex item will shrink.
     */
  ```

- Change direction of flow
  ```css
  flex-direction: row;
  /* flex-direction: column; is also available as well as row-reverse and column-reverse*/
  ```

- Do flex items wrap or not:
  ```css
  flex-wrap: wrap;
  flex-wrap: nowrap;
  ```

- Shorthand for flex flow:
  ```CSS
  flex-direction: row;
  flex-wrap: wrap;
  /* can be exhchanged for the shorthand */
  flex-flow: row wrap;
  ```
- Using `gap` to space items:
  ```css
  .container {
  height: 140px;
  padding: 16px;
  background: plum;
  border: 4px solid indigo;
  display: flex;
  align-items: center;
  justify-content: center;
  gap: 8px; 
  }
  ```

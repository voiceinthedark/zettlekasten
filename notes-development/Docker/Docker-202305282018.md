## Docker as a portable hosting machine
Docker works as containers for applications completely independent on local host.

### Docker Architecture
![](docker-architecture.png)

### Pulling images from Docker Hub
`docker pull nginx:1.23`

### Creating a container from an Image
`docker run nginx:1.23`

#### Run the container in detached mode
`docker run -d nginx:1.23`

#### publish a port to expose container on local host
`docker run -d -p 9000:80 nginx:1.23`

#### Stopping a container
`docker stop {container-id}`

#### check for active containers
`docker ps`

##### Check all containers on local host
`docker ps -a`

### naming a container
`docker run -d --name Web-server -p 9000:80 nginx:1.23`

## Creating an image from a Dockerfile

A dockerfile example:

```bsh
FROM node:1.19-alpine 
// Download the base image node. This is  the base of the container
// alpine is a lightweight linux distribution

COPY package.json /app/
COPY src /app/
// Copies the file listed above from source (host) to container (destination)
// The docker file will create any folder structure listed above

WORKDIR /app
// Change the working directory to the app folder created on the container

RUN npm install
// A shell command to run after installing the base image"

CMD ['node', 'server.js']
// The final line should include the command to run our application
```

Once done we can build the image from our Dockerfile:

`docker build -t node-app:1.0 .`

Finally after the image is built we can run the container and expose it to our local host.

`docker run -d -p 3000:3000 node-app:1.0`

If a test is failing, one of the first things to check should be whether the test is failing when it's the only test that runs. To run only one test with Jest, temporarily change that `test` command to a `test.only`:

```javascript
test.only('this will be the only test that runs', () => {
      expect(true).toBe(false);});test('this test will not run',
     () => { 
         expect('A').toBe('A');
     });
```

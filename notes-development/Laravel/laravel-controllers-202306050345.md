## Laravel controller

### Form request data
For more complex validations, we use the Form request validation

`php artisan make:request StorePostRequest`
The generated form request class will be placed in the app/Http/Requests directory. If this directory does not exist, it will be created when you run the make:request command. Each form request generated by Laravel has two methods: authorize and rules.

```php
/**
 * Get the validation rules that apply to the request.
 *
 * @return array<string, \Illuminate\Contracts\Validation\Rule|array|string>
 */
public function rules(): array
{
    return [
        'title' => 'required|unique:posts|max:255',
        'body' => 'required',
    ];
}
```

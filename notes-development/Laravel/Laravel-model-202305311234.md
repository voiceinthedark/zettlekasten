## Creating models for the laravel MVC
In order to create a model and controller as well as a database migration:
```bash
php artisan make:model -mrc Chirp
```

This command will create three files for you:

- app/Models/Chirp.php - The Eloquent model.
- database/migrations/<timestamp>_create_chirps_table.php - The database migration that will create your database table.
- app/Http/Controller/ChirpController.php - The HTTP controller that will take incoming requests and return responses.

## Model Mutators
in order to apply a mutation on a model field, create a function with the same name
as the field and implement the code needed.

```php
protected function password() : Attribute{
    return Attribute::make(
        set: fn(string $value) => bcrypt($value),
    );
}
```

## Model accessors

```php
protected function name() : Attribute{
    return Attribute::make(
        get: fn(string $value) => strtoupper($value),
    );
}
```

Returning to programming after a long hiatus.
the hiatus was not intentional nor wanted, it was forced due to lack
of electrical power and outages. Well it should be said that outages is an
understatement if any; since the electricity is never around in the first place.

Now that I might install solar power (hopefully), I may guarantee a 24hours
electricity output, and I can get hopefully back to normal.

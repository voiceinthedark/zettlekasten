walked around 10km today at work; I am doing manual labor lately, hoping to get back in shape as well as make some money.
Been doing this for the past three weeks now, can't say I am dissatisfied, I am actually feeling much better. Especially after my falloff with the hernia.
At the moment am trying to get back into programming by revising the foundational stones of web development.
Hopefully I will get back in shape, both physically and mentally.

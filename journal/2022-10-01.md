New month, and 4th day of the return, I think with the outages and work I should be able to get back in mental shape in approximately 20 days.
I am picking up all the loose ends and refamiliarizing myself with what I already know.
Today I am focusing mostly on Javascript.
I am also following the Odin project curriculum which I had already started back then.
